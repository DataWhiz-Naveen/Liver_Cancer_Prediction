# Liver Cancer Analysis
This repo contains notebooks on various datasets as a practice on data analysis, all notebooks include:

1. Data Cleaning.
2. Data Visualization.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis.

Each project contains detailed README file that cointains an informative description of the dataset and its columns, 
summary of exploring the dataframe and step to be taken in data cleaning phase, visualizations findings and EDA conclusions. 

# Liver Cancer Prediction - Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Liver cancer is a serious disease and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Catching it early and understanding what increases the risk can make a huge difference in saving lives. This project dives into **liver cancer data using SQL** to uncover important patterns, identify high-risk areas, and classify patients based on their risk levels.

Using **MS SQL Server**, we clean, process, and analyze data that includes patient demographics, lifestyle choices, and medical history. The goal is to find key factorsâ€”like **alcohol use, smoking, hepatitis infections, obesity, and access to healthcare**â€”that may contribute to the disease.

### Why This Matters
âœ” Helps understand **where** and **why** liver cancer is most common.  
âœ” Highlights major **risk factors** that could be targeted for prevention.  
âœ” Builds a **risk classification model** to help identify high-risk patients.  

The insights from this project can support **healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers** in improving **prevention, screening, and treatment strategies** for liver cancer.
